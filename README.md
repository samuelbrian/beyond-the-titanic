# Beyond the Titanic

*Prepare to engage yourself in a most exciting adventure...*

```
    As the game begins you find yourself standing on board the Titanic, on her
maiden voyage.  Of course, that particular voyage was never completed!
    Your goal is to survive and somehow get back to your home in the United
States.

This is a 2017 Free Pascal port of Scott Miller's **Beyond the Titanic**,

**Beyond the Titanic** is best enjoyed on an 80x25 character terminal console.
