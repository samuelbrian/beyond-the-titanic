The STORY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As the game begins you find yourself standing on board the Titanic, on her
maiden voyage.  Of course, that particular voyage was never completed!
    Your goal is to survive and somehow get back to your home in the United
States.
    Most of your time will be spent solving numerous problems and dangers that
arise, like starvation and drowning.  If you've played any of Infocom's famous
text games you will notice that Beyond the Titanic is quite similar to Zork
and Planetfall.
    Hints:  Examine everything and make a map as you move through the many
game locations.  There are not any puzzles that cannot be solved logically;
apply an "If I were really there, I would do this..." type of attitude.
    To add to the game's realism sound effects are used throughout the game.

The COMMANDS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Here's a list of the major commands you will need to know in order to play
Beyond the Titanic.

QUIT - ends the current game.
SAVE - allows you to save your present game location.  Use a separate formatted
       disk.  Up to 26 SAVE files per disk.  SAVE names can be up to eight
       letters long.  To resume a previously SAVED game use the RESTORE
       command.
RESTORE - allows you to restore a SAVED game location.
DIAGNOSE - reveals your health, appetite, etc.
LOOK (or L) - does a brief examination of your current game location.
REPEAT (or R) - repeats your last line of commands.
WAIT (or Z) - lets one move pass without any action.
SCORE - gives you your current ranking.
ROOM DESCRIPTION (or RD) - toggles between full room descriptions or brief
    room descriptions.







MISCELLANEOUS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Beyond the Titanic only recognizes the first SEVEN letters of any word or
command.  (Note: Infocom games only use the first SIX letters.)
    The word AND is not understood.  You cannot say, for example, GET GUN
AND ROPE, or PUT ROPE AND KNIFE IN SACK.
    With the verbs GET and DROP you may refer to every object by saying
GET ALL or DROP ALL.  The word ALL is not accepted anywhere else.
    It is a good idea to draw a map as you find new rooms in the game.
Without a map it is easy to get lost, or it might be difficult to find a
room you need to get to in a hurry.
